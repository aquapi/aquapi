## Libs
I made JS libraries optimized for performance & bundle size.
- [**mapl**](https://github.com/mapljs/app): A compiled cross-runtime JS framework.
- [**stnl**](https://github.com/re-utils/stnl): A type definition format optimized for compilation.
- [**fast-crypt**](https://github.com/re-utils/fast-crypt): An efficient crypto library for all runtimes. 

And some low-level stuff.
- [**nuws**](https://github.com/aquapi/nuws): Low-overhead, opinionated uWebSockets bindings for Nelua.
