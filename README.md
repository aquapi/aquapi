I made JS libraries optimized for performance & bundle size.
- [**mapl**](https://github.com/mapljs/web): A compiled cross-runtime JS framework.
- [**stnl**](https://github.com/re-utils/stnl): A type definition format optimized for compilation.
- [**fast-crypt**](https://github.com/re-utils/fast-crypt): An efficient crypto library for all runtimes. 
- [**udic**](https://github.com/re-utils/di): Small, simple dependency injection library.
- [**ciorent**](https://github.com/re-utils/ciorent): Lightweight, low-overhead concurrency library.

With some benchmarks to verify their performance.
- [**startup-size**](https://github.com/js-benchmark-all/startup-size): JS startup time, bundle size and gzipped size benchmark.
- [**micro**](https://github.com/js-benchmark-all/micro): Micro-benchmarks for all JS runtimes and engines.

And low-level things sometimes.
- [**nuws**](https://github.com/aquapi/nuws): Low-overhead, opinionated uWebSockets bindings for Nelua.
